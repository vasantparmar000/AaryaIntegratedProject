<p>write about any one GSAT or NAVIC satellite.</p>
<p>What is the work of GSAT?</p>
<p>GSAT or Geosynchronous Satellite, is a series of satellites that provide communication services for India.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>GSAT satellites support telecommunications services for the Indian subcontinent, including television broadcasting,
internet, weather forecasting, disaster warning and etc.</p>
<p>1. Telecommunication: A telecommunication satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunication signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver 
at different locations on the earth.</p>
<p>Television broadcasting: it is the distribution of audiovisual content to viewers through the airwaves, cables, or satellites.
it can also refers to the telecommunications networks that distributes television content.</p>

    <p>Internet: it is a satellite-based internet service that is a part of Geo Stationary Satellite {GSAT} series of communication 
    satellites.</p>
    
    <p>Weather forecasting: Weather forecasts use a variety of methods to predict the state of the atmosphere at a given time and
    place, including satellite data, computer models, and human input.</p>
    
    <p>Disaster Warning: most of these satellites contain passive or active sensors that can be utilized by the scientific 
    community for the remote sensing of natural hazards. passive sensors record reflected [visible and infrared wavelengths]
    and emitted energy [thermal wavelengths].
